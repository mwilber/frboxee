FrontMyth
---------

To build the plugin:
--------------------
python setup.py py2app

The plugin with then be in the dist/ directory.

To create the package:
----------------------
Open the FrontMyth.pmdoc file with PackageManager. You may have to adjust the
path for the source. You can do this by:

Within PackageMaker, press the arrow next to the FrontMyth entry in the 
Contents area. Select the FrontMyth that appears there. Edit the Install entry
as needed. Leave the destination alone.

Then just click the build button at the top.

If your users complain that it doesn't work, you may have built while in the
'alias' mode of development. Delete the dist directory, and run the command
for building the plugin. This is because it when its in alias mode, for some 
reason it hard codes some paths in the launcher.

Development:
------------
Here's what I did to ease development. 
First, I create the app in 'alias' mode, with "python setup.py py2app -A"
Then I made a symlink to that application, in the FrontRow plugins area:

ln -s <sourcedir>/dist/FrontMyth.frappliance /System/Library/CoreServices/Front\ Row.app/Contents/PlugIns/

Then you'll be able to edit the .py file, and the changes are visible to 
Front Row. But you will have to restart Front Row on every change, since 
it will not reload the plugin with it. So I was doing: 

killall Front\ Row

Whenever I made a change.

Good luck.
